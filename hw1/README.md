NLP hw1 - Named Entity tagger with Viterbi algorithm

Quick View:

4_1.py: Replace infrequent words(Count(x) < 5) with a common symbol "_RARE_"

4_2.py: Implement a named entity tagger and make tag prediction base on emission rate

5_1.py: Print log probability for trigrams

5_2.py: Tag prediction using maximum likelihood estimates for transitions and emissions, Viterbi algorithm

6.py & 6_multiTag.py: Replace the rare words with different informative patterns, improved Viterbi
algorithm performance
